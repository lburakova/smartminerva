Smart Minerva
============

### Part 1: WebCrawler (Spider-man)
  * I scrape using Apache HTTPClient
  * I parse the data to SQLite

### Part 2: Schedule Builder
  * Queries the SQLite database
  * Stores schedules as 2D array
  * Will return all possible schedules without conflicts
  * Displays schedules in plain-text
  
### The Plan:
  * Develop for mobile
  * Code more efficiently
  * Export to popular calendar formats
  * Use a graph to determine which classes you can take based on pre-requisites
  * Alleviate traffic from Minerva by using a central server and process client side
  * To be continued...
